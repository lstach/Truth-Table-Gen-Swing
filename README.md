# Truth-Table-Gen-Swing
This is a truth table generator built with Java and the Swing package to make a desktop GUI application.  I originally sought out to make a desktop GUI version in Swing, along with a web app version in Spring.  However, I opted to switch to JavaFX for the desktop GUI application because Swing is older and used less frequently.  The updated JavaFX repo can be found [here](https://github.com/lstach/Truth-Table-Generator-JavaFX).

In terms of UI, this codebase doesn't do much.  All of the code works only within the console, and acts as a proof-of-concept for using the shunting yard algorithm to parse and calculate boolean expressions.  Specifically, it takes in a boolean expression from the console (each token must be separated by a space), outputs all combinations of true and false for the number of variables in the formula, converts the formula to reverse polish notation (RPN), and finally outputs the result of the formula for each combination of true/false.
